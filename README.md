Naming Convention:
1. ‘MNIST-fashion training set-49.csv’ = train
2. ‘MNIST-fashion testing set-49.csv’ = test
3. Data samples = dat_500_1, dat_500_2, dat_500_3, dat_1000_1 etc. (as in Haodong’s screenshot)
4. Models = mod_"type"_"samplesize"_"num" (e.g. mod_rf_500_1, mod_rf_500_2 etc. for random forest)
